# About Me Page – Visual Enhancement Requirements

## 1. Sectioned Layout
- Divide the existing text into clear sections:
  - **The 10X Multiplier**  
  - **Why AI Mastery Isn’t Obvious**  
  - **AI as a Shared Resource**  
- Use headings (## or ### in Markdown) for each section.

## 2. Typography & Color
- Use **bold** and *italic* text to emphasize key statements.
- Consider using a consistent accent color (e.g., blue or orange) for headings or callout boxes.

## 3. Callout Box or Highlight
- Select impactful quotes (e.g., “Projects we might've laughed off as impossible a year ago…”).
- Style them with a blockquote in Markdown:
  > Projects we might've laughed off as impossible a year ago…

## 4. Bullet Points & Numbered Lists
- Break down dense paragraphs into bullet points or numbered lists:
  - Steps for mastering AI
  - Best practices for iterative improvements

## 5. Incorporate Minimalist Imagery
- Insert small icons or illustrations to symbolize each subsection.
- Keep the style consistent across the page.

## 6. White Space
- Use empty lines in Markdown to visually separate sections.
- Avoid crowding text against images or callouts.

## 7. Optional CTA
- Conclude the page with a call to action:
  - [Subscribe](#)  
  - [Learn More](#)  
  - [Work with Me](#)
- Emphasize the CTA with bold text or a button in HTML if supported.

## 8. Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure headings, images, and callouts scale properly on small screens.
- Test on multiple devices or use responsive design tools to confirm.
