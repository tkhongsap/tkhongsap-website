## 1. Overview
The “Writing” page is intended to display **executive summaries** (or short excerpts) of articles you’ve published on LinkedIn (or Medium). Visitors can read the summary on your site, then click through to LinkedIn/Medium to view the full article. This structure avoids duplicating the entire article on your site, helps maintain brand consistency, and drives traffic to your external publications.

### Goals
- Provide a professional, **visually engaging** showcase of writing.
- Show **summaries/excerpts** on the site to pique reader interest.
- Redirect to **LinkedIn** (or Medium) for the full article.
- Maintain **brand consistency** with existing site design and layout.
- Support a **responsive** and **accessible** user experience.

## 2. Page Structure & Navigation

1. **Page URL**:  
   - `/writing` remains the primary URL for displaying summaries of articles.

2. **Navigation Menu**:  
   - Include a “Writing” item in the main navigation header, matching existing menu style, hover effects, and active states.

3. **Possible Sections**:
   - **Hero/Intro**: A brief heading (“Writing”) plus 1–2 sentences about the topics you write on.  
   - **Article Summaries**: A card- or grid-based layout featuring each article’s summary.  
   - **Footer/CTA**: Encourage visitors to follow you on LinkedIn or Medium, and ensure the standard site footer is included.

## 3. Executive Summary / Excerpt Feature

1. **Summary Text**  
   - Each card includes a **short excerpt** (50–100 words) that captures the main points of the article.  
   - Summaries should be **original text** (i.e., not the exact text from LinkedIn) to avoid duplicate content issues.  
   - If you prefer a direct excerpt from the article, ensure it’s clearly marked as a snippet with a “Read Full Article on LinkedIn” link.

2. **Read More Button**  
   - Each summary ends with a button or link: “Read Full Article,” which opens the LinkedIn (or Medium) article in a new tab.  
   - Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security when linking to external sites in a new tab.

3. **Featured Image / Thumbnail**  
   - Each article card features an **image** (either the article’s cover image or a relevant stock image).  
   - If the article has no dedicated image, you can use a site-branded default placeholder image.

4. **Metadata** (Optional)  
   - Include the **publication date** or **reading time** estimate if desired.  
   - You might also note the platform (LinkedIn or Medium) as part of the card design.

## 4. Design & Layout Requirements

1. **Consistent Look and Feel**  
   - Match the site’s **typography, color scheme, and spacing** conventions.  
   - Use the same **heading styles** and **button styles** as found elsewhere on the site.

2. **Card/Grid Layout**  
   - Display articles in a **responsive grid** (e.g., 2 or 3 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile).  
   - Each “card” includes:
     - Featured image (top)
     - Article title (or short heading)
     - Executive summary paragraph
     - Read More button

3. **Hover & Animation** (Optional)  
   - When hovering over a card, a subtle **shadow** or **scale** effect can highlight interactivity.
   - Keep animations consistent with any used on other parts of the site.

4. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
   - Cards stack vertically on smaller screens.  
   - Buttons and text remain readable (larger tap targets, legible font sizes).

5. **Brand Elements**  
   - Ensure brand logos, colors, and fonts align with existing design guidelines.  
   - If you have a custom brand style guide, follow it for spacing, shape, and styling.

## 5. Technical & SEO Considerations

1. **Performance**  
   - **Lazy-load images** so that featured images only load when in the viewport.  
   - Avoid embedding the full LinkedIn page via iframe (which can slow loading and disrupt design). A short excerpt with an external link is more performant.

2. **Structured Data** (Optional)  
   - Consider adding [Article schema](https://schema.org/Article) for each item, but note the canonical version is on LinkedIn or Medium.  
   - If you only show a summary, you can mark it as a “summary or snippet” rather than the full article.

3. **Avoiding Duplicate Content**  
   - Summaries should be **unique text** rather than full copy-paste of the article.  
   - If you do copy a snippet, keep it under ~100 words, and link to the original with a **canonical reference** (if needed).

4. **Accessibility**  
   - **Alt text** for images, describing them for screen reader users.  
   - Proper heading hierarchy: each card’s title might be an H3 if the page heading is an H1 or H2.  
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards for readability.

5. **Open Graph & Social Sharing**  
   - If users share your “Writing” page, ensure you have an appropriate **meta og:image** and **og:description** so it looks appealing on social platforms.

## 6. Implementation Workflow

1. **Content Gathering**  
   - Collect article titles, publish dates, original links, and any relevant images.  
   - Write short **executive summaries** (50–100 words) for each article.

2. **Data Storage**  
   - Store these details in a JSON/Markdown file, or use a small CMS.  
   - Example structure:
     ```json
     {
       "articles": [
         {
           "title": "AI & Me",
           "date": "2025-01-15",
           "summary": "An exploration of how AI has evolved...",
           "image": "/images/articles/ai-me-cover.jpg",
           "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/.../",
           "platform": "LinkedIn"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Front-End Development**  
   - Create a **responsive grid** or **card** component.  
   - Dynamically load article data (loop through JSON or pull from CMS).  
   - Implement transitions or hover states if desired.

4. **Testing**  
   - Check across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  
   - Validate mobile responsiveness.  
   - Ensure external links open as intended.

5. **Optimization**  
   - Compress images.  
   - Test load times (PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse).  
   - Refine or remove heavy scripts if performance is slow.

6. **Deployment & Review**  
   - Merge changes into production.  
   - Check live performance.  
   - Gather feedback for further refinements.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- **Executive Summaries Shown**: Each article displays a short excerpt plus a “Read More” link to LinkedIn/Medium.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Cards or summaries adapt nicely to various screen sizes.  
- **Brand Consistency**: Typography, colors, and spacing match the rest of the site.  
- **Good Performance**: Page loads quickly, images are optimized.  
- **Accessible & Clear**: Alt text is provided, text contrast is sufficient, and links are clearly labeled.  
- **No Full Article Duplication**: Users see enough information to decide if they want to continue reading on LinkedIn/Medium.

## 8. Future Enhancements

1. **Tagging & Filtering**  
   - Allow filtering by topic or category (e.g., “AI,” “Tech,” “Leadership”).  

2. **Featured/Popular Articles**  
   - Highlight a “Featured” article at the top.  

3. **Search Functionality**  
   - Enable visitors to search for keywords within article summaries.  

4. **Email Newsletter Integration**  
   - Prompt visitors to subscribe to a newsletter if they enjoy your writing.
