## 5 · My Vision – AI-First Company

> Becoming **AI-First** isn’t an add-on; it’s a default lens for product design, decision-making, and hiring.

Key pillars:

1. **Systems that learn & adapt** (continuous data loops)  
2. **Process redesign, not mere automation**  
3. **Teams equipped to *use* AI, not just demo it**  
4. **Experiment → learn → ship fast** — pace of learning beats polish
