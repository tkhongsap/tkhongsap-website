# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists to track project progress for a **Portfolio or Weekend Project Page** in your personal website.

## Creating Task Lists

1. **Use Markdown Files**  
   - Create one or more `.md` files (e.g., `TASKS.md`, `FEATURE_TASKS.md`) in your project root or a dedicated `docs/` folder.  
   - Name the files descriptively based on each phase or feature set (e.g., `PORTFOLIO_TASKS.md`, `WEEKEND_PROJECT_TASKS.md`).

2. **Recommended Structure Within Each Task File**

   ```markdown
   # [Feature or Project Phase Name]

   A brief description of the purpose and overall goal of the tasks in this file.

   ## Completed Tasks
   - [x] Brief description of tasks already finished  
     (e.g., “Initialized new repository for personal website,” “Added basic layout and styling.”)

   ## In Progress Tasks
   - [ ] Brief description of tasks currently being worked on  
     (e.g., “Create portfolio gallery section,” “Write short descriptions for weekend projects.”)

   ## Upcoming Tasks
   - [ ] Brief description of tasks to do next  
     (e.g., “Add contact form for inquiries,” “Include search functionality for blog posts.”)
