But even with aggressive use, you're still missing out if you’re not prompting effectively.\n\nAI doesn't read your mind; it reads your prompt!\n\nAI doesn't read your mind; it reads your prompt!\n\nDuring a recent training on productivity tools and Gen-AI with my friends and colleagues, I noticed a common theme: the results hinge on how we communicate with it (this is no surprise). The surprise was that not too many people could communicate effectively with it. While many were excited about AI’s potential, creating precise prompts was a common challenge.\n\nSuccess with generative AI isn’t about knowing everything but about asking the right questions.\n\nWith the right techniques and practice, people quickly noticed improved outcomes.\n\nHere are simple guidelines I follow, and this is based on prompt engineering guidelines from OpenAI\n\nGuidelines for Better Prompting:\n\nPractical Prompting Tips:\n\nWhile there are many prompting libraries available from sources like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini, mastering prompting is a personal journey. It’s about developing your style through practice and iteration.\n\nThink of it as conversing with the system, where clarity and specificity lead to better responses. With some guidelines in mind and a commitment to experimenting, you’ll find what works best for you.\n\nTakeaway: In AI, success is all about how you prompt.
