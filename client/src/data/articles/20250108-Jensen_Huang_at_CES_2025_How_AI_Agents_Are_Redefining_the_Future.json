His keynote wasn’t merely about technological updates; it offered a perspective on the future of work and the role of AI in reshaping industries.\n\nLet’s explore some of the standout ideas shared during the event.

That’s the promise of agentic AI — digital collaborators capable of managing customer service, payroll, coding, and much more.\n\n“The IT department of every company will become the HR department for AI agents,” he explained. It’s not as far-fetched as it sounds. These agents are already being integrated into workflows, assisting with routine and complex tasks alike.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, generative AI could automate 60 to 70 percent of activities that currently consume employees’ time, freeing them to focus on more strategic roles. On a global scale, Goldman Sachs projects generative AI could increase GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion.\n\nSmall businesses could use AI agents to scale faster, while larger organizations may find entirely new ways to innovate. At the same time, traditional roles will adapt, shifting toward creativity and problem-solving.\n\nThe economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier\n\nGenerative AI's impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy-and the era is…\n\nwww.mckinsey.com\n\nAI may start to boost US GDP in 2027\n\nglobal economic growth: Goldman Sachs Research forecasts AI will start having a measurable impact on US GDP in 2027 and…\n\nwww.goldmansachs.com\n\nScaling AI: The Three Laws\n\n“More Is More”\n\nAI thrives on scale. The more data it processes, the better it gets. This principle forms the foundation of the three scaling laws driving today’s AI advancements:\n\nThese laws enable AI to handle increasingly complex challenges, from generating realistic simulations to orchestrating intricate workflows.\n\nThe Year of AI Agents\n\n“2025 Belongs to Agents”\n\nThis year isn’t just about AI; it’s about AI agents. These systems are evolving beyond simple digital tools into collaborators capable of performing multi-step tasks and adapting to unexpected challenges.\n\nHe underscored their significance, explaining how they’re changing how we approach work, creativity, and decision-making. 2025 marks a turning point — a year when agents become integral to both business and personal applications.\n\nA Connected, AI-Powered World\n\n“AI Everywhere”\n\nThe future isn’t just about applying AI to specific tasks — it’s about embedding it into every aspect of life. He outlined how AI could reshape our daily routines:\n\nAnd with a touch of humor, he added: “One day, they’ll realize… they’re agents too.”\n\nThis vision isn’t without challenges. Building a world where AI is effective and responsible requires collaboration, thoughtful design, and safeguards to ensure systems serve society’s best interests.\n\nMy Thought\n\nThe keynote wasn’t just a showcase of NVIDIA’s latest innovations but a call to consider how AI will reshape how we work and live. From AI agents transforming businesses to scaling laws driving smarter systems, the insights offered a vision of opportunity and progress.\n\nAs he pointed out:\n\n“The future isn’t about replacing humans — it’s about amplifying what we can achieve together.”\n\n“The future isn’t about replacing humans — it’s about amplifying what we can achieve together.”\n\nAs AI continues to evolve, the real question isn’t whether we’ll embrace it — it’s how we’ll use it to enhance work, creativity, and the industries of tomorrow.",
