(And How to Become One)\n\nA beginner’s guide to understanding AI engineering and charting a successful career path in this booming field.\n\nKenji\n\nAI Unscripted\n\n26\n\nT\nhe field of AI engineering is booming, and for good reason. The demand for AI applications is skyrocketing across industries, and the barriers to entry for building AI-powered systems are lower than ever.\n\nNow is the perfect time if you’ve ever considered diving into this exciting field. But what exactly does AI engineering involve, and how can you chart a path to join this rapidly growing profession?\n\nWhat Is AI Engineering?\n\nAt its heart, AI engineering is about building smart systems that solve real-world problems. AI engineers use tools and techniques to develop applications that increase efficiency, cut costs, and improve decision-making.\n\nIt’s not just about coding; it’s about creating systems that make life easier and businesses smarter.\n\nIt’s not just about coding; it’s about creating systems that make life easier and businesses smarter.\n\nThink of the personalized recommendations on Netflix, the navigation systems in your car, or even robots performing surgery. These are all powered by AI engineering. AI is expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 — more than the combined output of China and India today.\n\nOpportunities for AI engineers are growing rapidly across industries.\n\nOpportunities for AI engineers are growing rapidly across industries.\n\nHow Is AI Engineering Different from Traditional Machine Learning?\n\nWhile AI engineering and machine learning share some common ground, they’re not the same. Here’s how they differ:\n\nWhat Does an AI Engineer Do?\n\nAI engineers do more than write code. They’re problem-solvers, innovators, and collaborators. Here are some of their main responsibilities:\n\nChallenges in AI Engineering\n\nAI engineering isn’t all smooth sailing. Here are some common challenges:\n\nWhat Skills Do You Need to Get Started?\n\nIf you’re wondering what it takes to become an AI engineer, here’s a roadmap to guide you:\n\nWhy Now Is the Time to Start\n\nThe tools to become an AI engineer have never been more available. You don’t need a PhD or years of experience to get started. Open-source libraries, online courses, and active communities make it straightforward to begin your journey. With AI reshaping industries and creating new opportunities, now is an ideal time to dive in.\n\nStart small. Take an online course, build a simple project, or experiment with foundation models. The key is to start — you’ll learn as you go.",
