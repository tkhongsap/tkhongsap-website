I’ve shared my experiences with it before — how it changed the way I tackle complex documents and stay on top of endless reading lists. But after testing the new features released last month, I had to revisit the topic. The updates are just that good. Here’s what I’ve been loving.\n\n1. Guided Conversations: Make Your Research Personal\n\nThis feature lets you provide instructions before generating a “Deep Dive” Audio Overview, tailoring the AI’s focus to specific topics or details. It ensures the results are perfectly aligned with your needs.\n\nFor example, I recently worked through a 500+ page PDF on autoencoders and cybersecurity. By asking the AI to focus on fundamental principles, practical implementations, and real-world examples, I saved hours of sifting through unrelated content. The screenshot above shows exactly how I set it up.\n\nWhether you’re tackling dense research or getting into specifics, this is a feature that saves time and effort.\n\n2. Background Listening: Multitasking Made Easier\n\nI’ll admit, this isn’t a feature I use often — and for a good reason. I usually consume AI-generated podcasts while commuting or driving, and let’s be honest, interacting with it mid-drive isn’t exactly safe. (No one needs a multitasking disaster behind the wheel!)\n\nBut when I’m at my desk or in a quiet space, this feature shines. Imagine having a long report turned into an audio summary while you keep working. As the podcast plays, you can still pull up quotes or dive into more details without pausing the audio.\n\nIt’s a subtle but super useful addition for those moments when you need to juggle tasks.\n\nReal-World Applications: Beyond Research\n\nI’m not the only one benefiting from these updates. Here’s how others are using it:\n\nWorth Writing About Again? Absolutely.\n\nThese updates have made an already great tool even better. Whether you’re trying to manage endless readings, keep your research organized, or just make life a bit easier, it’s worth checking out.\n\nHave you tried it yet, or are you thinking about giving it a shot? I’d love to hear how you’re using it. Drop a comment or leave a clap — it’s always great to hear from others who are finding new ways to make work simpler.\n\nThanks for reading, and here’s to smarter, easier ways of getting things done.\n\nGoogle Notebook LM — Part 2: Make Your Podcast Better | by Kenji | Sep, 2024 | Medium\n\nNotebook LM: Your Personal AI Assistant for Work and Life | by Kenji | Sep, 2024 | Medium",
