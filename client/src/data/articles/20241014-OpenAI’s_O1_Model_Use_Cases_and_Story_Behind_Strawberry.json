I wasn’t planning to write about OpenAI’s O1 model initially — there’s already a ton of content out there. But after listening to the Training Data Podcast, where three OpenAI researchers shared their insights about O1, I found their experiences too compelling not to share. So, I’ll quickly cover how O1 works (I am sure if you are readimg this, you have a basic idea how it works), its real-world applications, and yes, even the story behind “strawberry.”\n\nHow Does O1 Work?\n\nQ: How does O1 differ from previous language models?\n\nA: Unlike previous models like GPT-4, O1 was designed to “think” for longer periods, backtrack, and self-correct. As one of the researchers put it, “We thought one thing we should try is to have the AI think longer.” This careful, reflective process sets O1 apart, making it much better suited for handling complex, multi-step problems.\n\nQ: Can you give an example of how O1 approaches problem-solving?\n\nA: Sure. When O1 solves a math problem, for example, it can stop, backtrack, and say, “Wait, this is wrong. Let me reconsider and figure out the right path forward.” This self-correction ability allows O1 to handle complex tasks better than previous models.\n\nWhat Are Some Potential Use Cases for O1?\n\nLet’s explore some standout examples, and I’ll share my own experience using O1 as well.\n\nQ: Can O1 help with coding and software development?\n\nA: Yes, O1 performs well at coding tasks, from simple HTML games to full iOS apps. As someone who has personally used O1 for coding, I can confirm that its performance far exceeds previous models like GPT-4. I’ve used O1 when I hit roadblocks in my own coding, and its ability to think for longer periods has helped me find solutions that would have taken me hours to figure out. However, due to daily and weekly limits, I need to plan carefully when I rely on it.\n\nQ: How can O1 be used in business and management?\n\nA: O1 can provide comprehensive business advice, assist with crisis management, and help develop strategies. It has demonstrated an improved capacity to analyze complex data and provide strategic solutions, outperforming previous models in tasks like creating detailed crisis management plans.\n\nQ: Can O1 assist with legal work?\n\nA: Yes, O1 shines by reviewing contracts and ensuring numerical consistency across long documents — something GPT-4 sometimes misses. This ability to methodically go through contracts and catch potential issues makes O1 highly valuable for legal professionals, though it’s still essential to have a human lawyer review the work for accuracy.\n\nQ: How can O1 contribute to scientific research?\n\nA: O1 can speed up research by quickly generating code replicating complex projects. Researchers can use O1 as a brainstorming partner.\n\nWhat’s the Story Behind the Name “Strawberry”?\n\nQ: Is there a special meaning behind the project name “Strawberry”?\n\nA: The name “Strawberry” doesn’t have any deep significance. A researcher explained that someone needed to come up with a code name, and someone in the room was eating strawberries at the time. It’s simply a coincidence that it aligns with a popular AI reasoning question about strawberries. :-)\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nQ: How can users get the most out of O1?\n\nA: To get the most out of O1, it’s important to provide clear and detailed prompts, with relevant context. O1’s real advantage is its ability to handle complex, multi-step problems and provide well-reasoned responses. Whether you’re a coder, business leader, legal professional, or researcher, O1 has the potential to become an invaluable tool in your workflow.",
