I’ll admit that I’m only a casual user of DeepSeek, but this release has me seriously considering creating my own applications and solutions with its APIs.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 Release | DeepSeek API Docs\n\n⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1\n\napi-docs.deepseek.com\n\nFull disclosure: I haven’t built any applications or done any analysis using DeepSeek APIs yet. However, with the R1 model’s impressive performance metrics and significantly lower API costs compared to competitors, I’m giving serious thought to switching my API calls to R1.\n\nAs for concerns about data security, considering DeepSeek is a Chinese company? Honestly, not really. I trust DeepSeek just as much as I trust OpenAI.\n\nWith that said, let’s talk about what makes DeepSeek R1 stand out — its performance, features, and cost.\n\nBetter Problem-Solving, Smarter AI\n\nDeepSeek R1 isn’t your average AI model. It’s designed to think, reason, and deliver answers more accurately. Unlike standard language models, R1 builds a detailed Chain of Thought (CoT) before producing its final answer — and this transparency makes all the difference.\n\nHere’s what caught my attention:\n\nR1’s performance makes it a strong choice for tasks requiring advanced problem-solving and logic.\n\nFeatures That Really Matter\n\nDeepSeek R1 comes with some standout features:\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"<DeepSeek API Key>\", base_url=\"https://api.deepseek.com\")\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-chat\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"},\n    ],\n    stream=False\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n\nSwitching to R1 from other platforms feels effortless, thanks to its developer-friendly design.\n\nAffordable AI at Scale\n\nLet’s talk cost — this is where DeepSeek R1 shines. Compared to OpenAI’s models, R1 is incredibly affordable. Check out the numbers:\n\nOpenAI o1:\n\nDeepSeek R1:\n\nR1’s pricing makes advanced AI accessible to startups, solo developers, and researchers without deep pockets.\n\nSwitching to DeepSeek R1: Quick and Easy\n\nTransitioning to DeepSeek R1 doesn’t take much effort. Its APIs follow a familiar structure, making the switch seamless. Here’s an example of using R1’s deepseek-reasoner model for reasoning tasks:\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"<DeepSeek API Key>\", base_url=\"https://api.deepseek.com\")\n\n# Round 1\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"9.11 and 9.8, which is greater?\"}]\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-reasoner\",\n    messages=messages\n)\n\nreasoning_content = response.choices[0].message.reasoning_content\ncontent = response.choices[0].message.content\n\n# Round 2\nmessages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': content})\nmessages.append({'role': 'user', 'content': \"How many Rs are there in the word 'strawberry'?\"})\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-reasoner\",\n    messages=messages\n)\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nDeepSeek R1 offers a compelling combination of reasoning power, transparency, and affordability. As someone who hasn’t dived deeply into DeepSeek before, I’m genuinely excited about the possibilities R1 presents.\n\nWhether you’re crafting new applications or upgrading existing workflows, DeepSeek R1 gives you the tools to innovate without compromise.",
