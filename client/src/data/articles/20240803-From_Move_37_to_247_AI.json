We’re not talking about some far-off future — this is happening right now as we speak.\n\nYou might be thinking, “Haven’t we been through big changes before? The Industrial Revolution, the Internet boom — we adapted then, we’ll adapt now.” And you’re right; we have seen massive shifts before. But the AI revolution is different.\n\nThink about it. The Industrial Revolution changed how we work and produce goods, but it took decades to unfold. The Internet revolutionized how we communicate and access information, and that took years to really take hold.\n\nBut AI? It’s moving at lightning speed. We’re not talking about decades or even years — we’re talking about months. Just look at the progression: from AlphaGo to GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 and Claude. The leaps in capability are staggering. A year and a half ago, one can argue that AI systems had an estimated IQ of around 120 — pretty smart, right? Now, I am pretty sure we’re looking at AIs with IQs of 150 or higher. That’s genius-level intelligence. And it happened in just 18–24 months. Can you imagine where we’ll be in another year? The capabilities of AI are doubling not every few years, not even every year, but every few months. It’s mind-boggling.\n\nUnlike previous revolutions that mainly affected specific industries or aspects of life, AI is set to transform everything. From healthcare to education, from art to science, from our jobs to our relationships, AI’s impact will be all-encompassing. It’s a fundamental shift in what it means to be human in ways we’re only beginning to understand.\n\nI’ve spent years working with mathematical models, data, machine learning, and now AI systems, watching them evolve, and I can tell you: this is not science fiction. This is happening now, in labs and tech companies around the world. And it’s going to reshape our society in ways we can barely comprehend.\n\nI have argued that integrating AI into our daily lives or workflows to boost productivity and efficiency has great potential and benefits. But there is another side — the risk, which I haven’t written much about. I want to make it clear that there will be some, if not a lot, impact on society, and we need to understand and think about it so we can evolve with it.\n\n1. The Dangers of AI\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong — AI has incredible potential. The advancements we just talked about could solve some of humanity’s biggest challenges. But we need to be wide-eyed about the risks. It’s not just about losing jobs; we’re talking about a technology that could reshape power dynamics, relationships, and the fabric of our society.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers? AI in the wrong hands. Imagine a world where bad actors have access to superintelligent systems, and I am sure there is no lack of trying. They could manipulate markets, spread misinformation at an unprecedented scale, or even develop autonomous weapons. It’s not science fiction — it’s a very real possibility.\n\nThen there’s the question of control. As these systems get smarter, how do we ensure they align with human values? It’s not as simple as programming a set of rules. These AIs are learning and evolving on their own. They’re developing their own kind of intelligence that might be fundamentally different from ours.\n\nBut the real issue isn’t the machines — it’s us. AI is just a tool, an incredibly powerful one. Like any tool, its impact depends on how we use it. And let’s face it, not everyone out there has good intentions. While many of us dream of using AI to create a more equitable world and solve global problems, some bad actors see it differently. They’re not aiming for a society where peace and prosperity are the norm. Instead, they’re looking at AI and seeing dollar signs, or worse, a weapon.\n\nThese people will use AI to exploit others, manipulate markets, spread misinformation, or even cause harm on a massive scale. And they’re not going to wait around while we debate the ethics. The real danger isn’t AI itself — it’s us not taking this seriously enough. We’re not thinking through the consequences and not putting the right safeguards in place. We’re handing out nuclear reactors like toys and hoping everyone plays nice.\n\nWe’re at a crossroads. The decisions we make now about how we develop and deploy AI will shape humanity’s future. It’s time we start taking this seriously. While the dangers are real, so is the potential for good. It’s up to us to steer this ship in the right direction and to make sure it doesn’t get hijacked along the way.\n\n2. AI Taking Over Jobs\n\nThe job market as we know it is about to undergo a massive shake-up. And it’s happening faster than most people realize. Remember how we talked about AI’s capabilities doubling every few months? Well, that’s not just about playing chess or writing poetry. It’s about performing tasks we’ve always considered uniquely human.\n\nImagine walking into a corporate office where AI handles everything from data analysis to financial forecasting. Picture a newsroom where AI writes articles, fact-checks in real-time, and even predicts trending topics. Or think about a law firm where AI researches cases, drafts contracts, and predicts outcomes with scary accuracy.\n\nSound far-fetched? It’s already starting to happen.\n\nAnd it’s not just creative jobs that are at risk. As AI becomes more advanced and capable, even traditionally ‘safe’ analytical and knowledge-based jobs are at risk. Think about it: AI can process and analyze data faster and more accurately than any human.\n\nFinancial analysts? AI can crunch numbers, spot trends, and make predictions in seconds.\nData scientists? AI can sift through mountains of data and find patterns we might never see.\nJournalists and reporters? AI is already writing articles and generating reports. It can gather information from countless sources, fact-check in real-time, and produce coherent stories.\n\nFinancial analysts?

AI is already writing articles and generating reports. It can gather information from countless sources, fact-check in real-time, and produce coherent stories.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about self-driving vehicles — they’re not just coming for taxi drivers, but for the entire transportation and logistics industry.\n\nEven fields like law and medicine aren’t immune. AI can review legal documents, predict case outcomes, and even assist in diagnoses. It’s not replacing lawyers and doctors outright, but it’s certainly changing the game.\n\nNow, I’m not saying every job will disappear overnight. But the change is coming, and it’s coming fast. In the next five years, we could see a seismic shift in the job market. Jobs that seem secure today might not exist tomorrow.\n\nBut this isn’t necessarily all doom and gloom. Yes, many jobs will disappear, but new ones will be created too. The question is: will there be enough new jobs? And more importantly, will we be prepared for them?\n\nThis is where things get tricky. The jobs of the future will require a whole new set of skills. We’re talking about jobs we can’t even imagine yet. How do you prepare for a job that doesn’t exist?\n\nThe writing’s on the wall. We need to start preparing now for a job market that looks radically different from today’s. It’s not just about learning new skills — it’s about learning how to learn, how to adapt, how to work alongside AI rather than compete with it.\n\nBecause let me tell you, if you’re trying to compete with AI on AI’s terms, you’ve already lost. Our advantage isn’t in processing power or data analysis. It’s in our creativity, our emotional intelligence, our ability to handle complex, unpredictable situations.\n\nSo yes, AI is going to take over many jobs. But it’s also going to create new opportunities for those who are ready to seize them. The question is: are you ready?\n\n3. Learn & Evolve\n\nIn this new AI-driven world, standing still is not an option. We need to become learning machines ourselves, constantly adapting and evolving.\n\nThink about it. AI is getting smarter by the day, mastering new skills at a pace we can barely keep up with. So what’s our move? I would argue that it means embracing a mindset of continuous learning.\n\nRemember when knowing how to use a computer was a special skill? Now, it’s as basic as knowing how to tie your shoelaces. Well, get ready because working with AI will become just as fundamental. And I’m not talking about simply knowing how to prompt ChatGPT. I’m talking about understanding how AI thinks, how it can amplify your work, and how to spot its limitations.\n\nBut it’s not just about learning to use AI tools. It’s about developing the skills that AI can’t easily replicate (note that it doesn’t mean that it won’t be able to): things like critical thinking, creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. These uniquely human skills? They’re going to be worth their weight in gold.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about ethics. As AI becomes more prevalent, understanding the ethical implications of AI use will be crucial. We need people who can navigate the murky waters of AI ethics and who can help ensure that AI is used responsibly and for the benefit of humanity.\n\nThe good news is that humans are incredibly adaptable. This is how we’ve survived and thrived throughout history. And now, we’ve got powerful tools at our fingertips to help us learn and grow.\n\nSo, start exploring. Remember, our ability to learn, adapt, and bring a human touch to problems is our edge in the age of AI. So sharpen it and keep it sharp.\n\n4. Securing Your Job Amidst AI\n\nIf you’re wondering how to keep your job when AI seems to be gunning for it, you are not alone. As I write this article, I am also pondering this question. My best advice to myself, and to you if you let me, is to focus on what makes us uniquely human.\n\nDon’t try to outcompete AI at its own game. Instead, focus on uniquely human strengths.\n\nCreativity? While AI can generate, humans still play a crucial role in paradigm-shifting innovations. Emotional intelligence, leadership, teamwork, and negotiation — these skills remain our forte.\n\nBecome an AI-human liaison. Learn to work effectively with AI. The future isn’t AI or humans, but AI and humans collaborating.\n\nDevelop interdisciplinary skills. Exciting innovations often occur at the intersection of different fields. Combining your industry knowledge with AI understanding can be a powerful asset.\n\nAt an abstract level, humans remain relevant in directing AI’s goals and applications. We’ll continue to guide AI on what we want and how we want it. The best outcomes will come from human-AI collaboration, not competition.\n\nEmbrace lifelong learning. Skills become obsolete faster than ever, so make continuous learning your habit. Stay curious and adaptable — it’s your key to remaining valuable.\n\nKeep an eye on emerging fields like AI ethics, explainable AI, and AI safety. These areas will need human expertise. New, unimaginable job opportunities and new economy will arise.\n\nRemember, AI is a powerful tool, but it’s still a tool. Be the person who wields it effectively. Understand AI’s strengths and weaknesses deeply. Use it to amplify your capabilities, not replace them. The goal is to work alongside AI, not against it. Embrace the technology while honing your uniquely human skills. It’s not about competing with AI, but using it to become your best self.\n\n5. Five Years From Now\n\nLet me paint you a picture of where we might be in just five years. It’s the biggest story of our generation, yet it’s often overshadowed by the day-to-day noise of politics and celebrity gossip.\n\nBy 2028, AI could be as ubiquitous as smartphones. AI assistants managing our schedules, AI doctors providing personalized health advice, AI teachers tailoring education to individual needs. In the workplace, AI could handle most routine tasks, freeing humans for creative and strategic work. But this also means many current jobs might vanish.\n\nOur interaction with technology will likely become more natural and intuitive. Virtual and augmented reality, powered by AI, could blur the lines between digital and physical worlds.\n\nWorryingly, many governments and regulators seem ill-prepared for this future. While some countries, like Singapore, have clear AI policies and budgetary support, others in the same region lag far behind. In these neighboring nations, there’s an alarming lack of public discourse on preparing citizens for this coming wave of AI-driven change.\n\nThe disparity in AI readiness between nations is stark. Advanced countries are actively working on both regulation and innovation, while in other regions, there’s a concerning silence from public officials about how to prepare for this impending change.\n\nThe future isn’t set in stone. What we do now will shape the world we live in five years from now. Are we going to be passive observers, or active participants in shaping this AI-driven future?\n\nThe choice is ours, and the time to make that choice is now. Don’t just watch this unfold — get involved. Learn about AI, voice your concerns, support responsible AI development. Your actions today could help steer us towards a future where AI benefits all of humanity, not just a select few.\n\nSo, what’s your next move in this rapidly approaching AI-driven world?\n\nThe choice is ours, and the time to make that choice is now. Don’t just watch this unfold — get involved. Learn about AI, voice your concerns, support responsible AI development. Your actions today could help steer us towards a future where AI benefits all of humanity, not just a select few.\nAs we face this coming wave of changes, let’s remember the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln:\n“The best way to predict the future is to create it.”\n\nThe choice is ours, and the time to make that choice is now.
