I discovered Google Notebook LM, a tool that allows us to load documents and engage with them interactively. While this feature isn’t new, what really excited me was its ability to create an audio podcast based on uploaded documents and information. Notebook LM generates a conversation-like podcast.\n\nBelow is a simple Introduction to Google Notebook LM audio. I took a detailed document on the tool’s functions, uploaded it into Notebook LM, and within minutes, it generated a full audio conversation. It felt like listening to an engaging discussion about the tool rather than just reading through paragraphs of information.\n\nI have to be honest — I haven’t figured out how to use this feature beyond learning and summarizing documents, but I think it’s an excellent addition.\n\nIf you really want to understand complex material, there’s no substitute for reading thoroughly and engaging deeply with the text. Listening is convenient, but proper comprehension often requires more focus.\n\nIt’s a solid product, and I’ll definitely be adding it to my toolkit. Whether you’re a researcher, content creator, or someone looking for a more efficient way to consume information, this tool offers a lot of potential.\n\nUpdated on 26th of September 2024\n\nI have been using the Podcast feature quite a bit for my own learning and consuming information. It’s kind of like skim reading, but by listening instead. If a research paper is worth a deeper dive, I’ll definitely read it in more detail. However, to create a quality podcast, I need to extract high-quality data from PDFs, especially when they are more complicated. Here’s my method: I use LlamaParse to extract complex data from these documents. You can read more about that here.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@kenji-onisuka/google-notebooklm-part-2-7baaacfb8bd8",
