While I have reservations about using it for writing, as the process helps me articulate reasoning and validate thoughts, my view on AI assistance for coding is totally different.\n\nChatGPT Canvas: Easier Writing, Mixed Feelings\n\nA Non-Writer’s Perspective on AI’s Latest Writing Tool\n\nmedium.com\n\nCoding’s future? It’s you plus AI, not you versus AI\n\nCoding’s future? It’s you plus AI, not you versus AI\n\nI’ve long advocated for AI-powered coding assistants. Whether you’re a beginner, mid-level developer, experienced software engineer, or hobbyist, these tools have become essential. Ignoring them risks falling behind in an increasingly competitive field.\n\nFeature Comparison: Canvas vs. Claude\n\nTo understand how Canvas measures up against its competition, I compared its capabilities with Claude 3.5 Sonnet Artifacts, which has set a benchmark in real-time AI-assisted coding. Here is what I came up with for comparison of key features:\n\nBoth systems offer robust coding assistance, but their approaches and strengths differ. Canvas excels in its dedicated interface and editing capabilities, while Claude stands out with its code execution feature.\n\nThe Verdict: Choosing the Right Tool\n\nBetween Canvas and Cluade, I think I am leaning toward Claude. The ability to run code and see real-time outputs is invaluable. While Canvas offers impressive features like in-line editing, adding logs, and language conversion, all those can be done in a proper IDE and you probably want to do that in an IDE like Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe Future of AI-Assisted Coding\n\nAs AI coding tools evolve, developers must adapt. Canvas and Claude each excel in different areas, but neither replaces human creativity. Choose wisely based on your needs, and use these assistants to enhance your skills, not substitute them. In this AI-driven era, your ability to leverage these tools effectively will set you apart.\n\nRemember, the future of coding isn’t just about AI — it’s about how you can collaborate with it. To put it in Naval Ravikant’s words:\n\n”The most interesting jobs of the future will involve working with AI, not competing against it.”\n\n”The most interesting jobs of the future will involve working with AI, not competing against it.”",
