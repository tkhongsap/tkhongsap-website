Promising capabilities ranging from detailed stock analysis to full-stack web development and even comprehensive trip planning, it’s been celebrated by many tech enthusiasts as a major leap ahead of well-known players like OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nManus\n\nManus is a general AI agent that turns your thoughts into actions. It excels at various tasks in work and life, getting…\n\nmanus.im\n\nFull disclosure: I don’t yet have personal access to Manus AI. I’ve applied for an invitation and am awaiting approval. This article reflects analysis and insights gathered from social media, community discussions, and online reviews as of March 11, 2025.\n\nWhat’s Driving the Excitement?\n\nManus AI has grabbed attention largely because of its ability to execute complicated, multi-step tasks from simple instructions independently. For instance:\n\nThese impressive use cases illustrate Manus AI’s promise of drastically streamlining workflows that typically involve multiple tools and human input.\n\nUnder the Hood: Originality or Orchestration?\n\nDiscussions on social platforms like X suggest Manus AI isn’t built on a completely new, proprietary foundation model.\n\nInstead, it appears to leverage existing, established foundation models — particularly Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet and Alibaba’s Qwen — and orchestrates them within a multi-agent framework.\n\nSeveral posts explicitly note Manus isn’t a newly created foundational model.\n\nOne user on X clearly stated, “Manus is built on Anthropic Claude Sonnet, not their own,” highlighting that its innovation comes from orchestrating and managing specialized AI agents rather than a fundamentally new model.\n\nThe Multi-Agent Secret Sauce\n\nA major talking point is Manus AI’s architecture. The platform reportedly utilizes a multi-agent system, where tasks are divided among specialized sub-agents, coordinated by an “executive” agent. This agentic structure breaks down complex tasks into smaller components, independently solving and assembling results into coherent final outputs.\n\nSentiment and Skepticism\n\nWhile Manus AI has generated substantial excitement, some skepticism is emerging due to limited accessibility and lack of transparency around its core technology.\n\nUsers have reported technical challenges like errors, loops, and occasional incomplete tasks, casting doubt on how consistently effective Manus truly is beyond curated demonstrations.\n\nIn contrast, DeepSeek — an earlier breakthrough from China — rapidly became open source and allowed immediate validation by a broader community, lending credibility and transparency that Manus AI currently lacks.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nWhether Manus AI truly represents a significant leap forward in AI capability or merely a sophisticated integration of existing technologies remains unclear without broader access. If its claims of autonomy and efficiency hold up under independent scrutiny, it could reshape the way we think about human-AI interaction.\n\nFor now, I’ll continue monitoring closely, and when I receive access, I’ll be ready to rigorously test it firsthand",
