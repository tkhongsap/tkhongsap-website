It’s a community-driven initiative that has gained significant traction and has now garnered over 30,000 stars on GitHub.\n\nAuthor’s Note ✍️\n\nI recently attempted to install it on a Windows system, and the process was more complex than I initially anticipated. Given these challenges, I decided to document my experience and create this guide, focusing on the installation process for Windows users. I hope it will be helpful for others who want to try installing OpenHands on a similar setup.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that this project's development is progressing rapidly. As a result, the steps and issues I describe here may not be the same when you attempt the installation in the future. Please use this guide as a general reference, but be prepared for potential differences and new challenges.\n\nPrerequisites 📋\n\nInstallation Steps 🛠️\n\ngit clone https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands.git\ncd OpenHands\n\n2. Create and Activate Conda Environment\n\nconda create -n opendevin python=3.11\nconda activate opendevin\n\n3.

After successfully building the frontend, start the backend server:\n\nuvicorn openhands.server.listen:app --reload --port 3000\n\n9. Start the Frontend Development Server. In a new terminal window\n\ncd frontend\nnpm run start -- --port 3001\n\nTroubleshooting 🔧\n\nOpenHands is under active development, so installation steps and requirements may change.
