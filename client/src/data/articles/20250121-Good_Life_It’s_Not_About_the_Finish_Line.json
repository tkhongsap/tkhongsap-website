Or do you have a good life now?\n\nFor many of us, the quality of life is measured against how closely it aligns with what we imagined it would be. Or at least, that’s what I used to think.\n\nWe compare our present reality to the mental snapshots we took years ago and tally up wins and losses.\n\nBut nothing ever looks exactly the way we think it will. Life is messy, unpredictable, and full of detours. And yet, some of us measure a good life by how well it matches that imagined picture. There’s nothing wrong with that — but I’ve realized that there are better ways to gauge the quality of a life well lived.\n\nHere are a few measuring sticks, I believe, for what makes a good life:\n\n1. The Relentless Desire to Evolve\n\nA good life isn’t static—it’s dynamic. It’s about the hunger to grow, change, and improve. Are you still learning? Are you still curious? Comfort zones feel safe, but growth happens when we stretch beyond them. The willingness to embrace discomfort—that’s where the magic lives.\n\n2. Conversations That Matter (Over Coffee or Tea)\n\nThink about the cups of coffee (or tea) shared over the years. The funny, serious, even tear-filled conversations. A good life isn’t about how many people you meet—it’s about the connections that matter. It’s about listening, sharing, and being truly present.\n\n3. Stopping to Smell the Roses (Or Travel Far and Wide)\n\nWhether it’s a solo walk around the block or a plane ticket to somewhere new, time spent wandering is time well spent. A good life makes room for these moments: when you step away from the noise and reconnect with the world, or just yourself.\n\n4. Walking Away When It’s Time\n\nStaying in toxic situations is easy. Walking away isn’t. The courage to leave relationships, jobs, or habits that no longer serve you—that’s strength. A good life means freeing yourself from what weighs you down and reaching for something lighter, brighter, better.\n\n5. Feeling Everything—The Good and the Bad\n\nA good life isn’t pain-free, nor should it be. It’s about feeling. All of it. Grief, joy, frustration, love—those emotions shape us. Numbness might seem tempting, but the real beauty of life lies in its rawness. Feeling deeply is what makes us human.\n\n6. Life Isn’t a Checklist—It’s a Journey\n\nA good life isn’t a race to a grand finish line. It’s not about ticking boxes or reaching some imaginary “finish line.” It’s about what you gather along the way: the lessons learned, the laughter shared, the quiet moments that catch your breath. Those are what matters.\n\nA good life isn’t about what you do. It’s about who you are.\nIt’s not about how the pieces fit together at the end; it’s about the joy, the growth, and the moments you treasure along the way.\n\nA good life isn’t about what you do. It’s about who you are.\n\nIt’s not about how the pieces fit together at the end; it’s about the joy, the growth, and the moments you treasure along the way.\n\nSo, I’ll leave you with this: What are you counting right now? And is it worth keeping track of?",
