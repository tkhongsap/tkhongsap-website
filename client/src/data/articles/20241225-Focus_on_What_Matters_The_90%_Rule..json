The year ahead promises to be equally dynamic and full of possibilities.\n\nAs I write this on Christmas Day, I reflect on the past year’s events and consider what lies ahead. Instead of focusing on technology today, I want to share something more personal: a life principle that I’ve decided to commit to as my New Year’s resolution fully. It’s something I’ve practiced intermittently, but this year, I’m determined to make it central to how I live and work. I hope it resonates with you.\n\nMy resolution is to focus on what truly matters. This principle emphasizes the importance of clarity in decision-making. I first came across the 90% Rule on the Modern Wisdom podcast, and it immediately resonated with me. The rule forces us to ask: “Does this opportunity or task truly matter?” If it doesn’t meet the threshold of being at least 90% important, it’s a clear no. By eliminating decisions that fall below this bar, we conserve energy and focus for what matters most, reducing decision fatigue and ensuring progress on meaningful goals.\n\nThis mindset not only sharpens priorities but also reduces overwhelm, making it easier to direct energy toward meaningful goals. While the concept is simple, sticking to it requires discipline. Saying no can be uncomfortable at first, but it becomes easier with practice as clarity grows about what truly matters.\n\nOptimal Effort for Maximum Output\n\nOnce we’ve identified what matters most, the next step is to channel our efforts wisely. Success isn’t about relentless exertion — it’s about finding a rhythm where our effort aligns with the results we seek. This means working smarter, not harder, to achieve sustainable progress without burnout.\n\nFor instance, imagine working on creating an application. At first, there’s an overwhelming urge to move as quickly as possible — adding features, pushing updates, and fixing bugs all at once. It feels like progress, but soon burnout sets in, and technical issues start piling up. In contrast, taking a steady, measured approach — rolling out updates on a consistent bi-weekly schedule — proves far more effective. With clear targets for each release, there’s time to ensure quality, refine features, and thoughtfully address feedback. This balanced rhythm not only improves the application but keeps everyone involved energized and focused.\n\nPractical Steps to Focus on What Matters\n\nTo turn this philosophy into practice, here are some steps I plan to implement — and encourage you to consider:\n\n💡 Establish a Daily Routine: Start each day with a plan that identifies one key task, two urgent items, and three maintenance activities. This structure ensures steady progress without overwhelm.\n\n💡 Evaluate and Simplify Inputs: Periodically review the information and advice you consume — social media, news, or even conversations. Keep only what aligns with your goals and remove the rest to avoid unnecessary distractions.\n\n💡 Learn to Say No: Protect your time and focus by declining opportunities or tasks that don’t support your goals. Saying no can feel uncomfortable, but it’s essential for maintaining clarity and energy.\n\n💡 Engage in Reflection: Practices like journaling can help uncover subconscious beliefs or habits that might be holding you back. Reflection fosters awareness, enabling you to make intentional choices.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nAs we step into the new year, learning to focus on what matters — and letting go of what doesn’t — is more important than ever. Adopting a simple daily routine and committing to essential priorities can create room for meaningful progress and a sense of balance.\n\nHere’s to making the coming year one of clarity, focus, and intentional growth.\n\nMerry Christmas, and wishing you a fulfilling and successful New Year",
