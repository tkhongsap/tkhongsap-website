From generating creative ideas to solving complex problems, these tools are powerful — but only if you know how to communicate with them effectively.\n\nIn my experience, getting the most out of an LLM isn’t about throwing questions at it and hoping for the best. It’s about crafting thoughtful prompts, iterating on your approach, and guiding the model like a collaborator.\n\nLet me stress this: how you craft and refine your prompts is critical. Whether you’re fine-tuning a system prompt for an app or simply improving your workflow, careful thought and iteration are essential. ‘\n\nTake the time to refine, test, and adjust your prompts. This isn’t something to rush or overlook. A well-thought-out prompt can mean the difference between receiving a generic answer and getting one that truly adds value.\n\nHere are six strategies — shaped by my personal experience — to help you master your conversations with LLMs.\n\n1. Start Simple\n\nWhen crafting prompts, I imagine I’m explaining the topic to someone encountering it for the first time. This ensures clarity and structure. The more specific your input, the better the model’s output.\n\nExample: Instead of saying, “Write code,” try: “Generate Python code for a calculator that handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.”\n\nPro Tip: Break down big tasks. For example, instead of asking for “a summary,” try, “Summarize this article into three key points, each explaining an emerging trend in AI.”\n\n2. Ask “Why?” and “How?”\n\nI’ve found that asking follow-up questions turns basic interactions into meaningful exchanges. Treating LLMs like brainstorming partners helps uncover deeper insights.\n\nExample: If Claude suggests an idea, ask: “Why did you choose this approach? How might an alternative strategy work?”\n\nPro Tip: Request a step-by-step explanation. For example: “Explain your reasoning step by step so I can understand the process.”\n\n3. Use Personas\n\nClaude can adapt its tone or role, which is a feature I love exploring. Asking it to adopt a specific persona can lead to tailored responses that better suit your needs.\n\nExample: “Respond as if you’re a career coach advising someone pivoting to a tech role” or “Explain this concept like a kindergarten teacher.”\n\nPro Tip: Test personas for specific tasks. For example, “Act as a lawyer drafting a concise agreement” or “Respond as a historian explaining the Industrial Revolution.”\n\n4. Be Specific with Creativity\n\nIf you’re looking for creative output, vague prompts won’t cut it. Be clear about tone, style, and structure.\n\nExample: “Write a short story about a future where humans and AI work together in the style of a mystery novel.”\n\nPro Tip: Use comparisons to guide creativity. For instance, “Write a speech inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., but address the challenges of climate change.”\n\n5. Test, Iterate, Refine\n\nLLMs sometimes miss the mark, and that’s okay. I see those moments as chances to improve how I frame my prompts. It’s a back-and-forth process.\n\nExample: If Claude gives an unsatisfying response, ask: “What could I have clarified in my request to make the answer more relevant?”\n\nPro Tip: Save different versions of responses. A small change in phrasing—like reordering words or using synonyms—can yield surprising improvements.\n\n6. Craft for Precision\n\nAchieving truly exceptional results takes patience and fine-tuning. The best prompts often emerge after several iterations.\n\nExample: If Claude struggles with tone, adjust your request: “Rewrite this with a professional tone suitable for an executive summary.”\n\nPro Tip: Frame prompts with goals in mind. For instance: “Focus on clarity and impact” or “Make this explanation approachable for non-experts.”\n\nFinal Thoughts: It’s About Collaboration, Not Commands\n\nThese strategies reflect what I’ve learned from personal experience and Amanda Askell’s thoughtful approach to Claude. The secret to unlocking the potential of LLMs lies in treating them as collaborators, not tools.\n\nPrompt engineering isn’t just a skill—it’s a mindset. It’s about how you guide the model, learn from its responses, and iterate on your approach.\n\nSo, Do You Want to Get into AI? Here’s What I Learned So Far\n\nPractical insights on starting with AI and experimenting with real-world use cases\n\nmedium.com",
