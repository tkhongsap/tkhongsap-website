  "content": "Why Mondays Are Now My Favorite Day of the Week\n\nDiscovering Peace and Fulfillment in a Career\n\nKenji\n\nMonday mornings often evoke mixed feelings. Some dread the start of the workweek, while others see it as an opportunity for new challenges. For me, it has become a symbol of personal growth and new beginnings.\n\nThis Monday began like many recent ones. I returned from an early morning run, greeted by a sky painted with dawn’s colors. As I ran, I reflected on my good fortune: a loving family and a new job that, while challenging, brings great satisfaction and happiness.\n\nMy previous position paid considerably more, which I once thought was crucial. I found myself in a cycle where money dictated my choices, leading to increasing unhappiness. Every Sunday night, I dreaded the week ahead, feeling anxious. I feared quitting because of the financial security, but this fear only increased my self-resentment.\n\nEventually, I hit a turning point and decided to make a change. It wasn’t easy, but it was necessary for my well-being. I moved to a role that pays less but better aligns with my values and passions. Now, I’m truly happier. This shift required adjusting my financial habits, but the resulting mental peace and fulfillment were worth it.\n\nThese days, I look forward to each Monday and the week ahead. Unlike before, when every task felt burdensome, I now feel energized and ready for new challenges. This change in outlook has improved both my professional and personal life. My family relationships have grown stronger, and I feel more present in our daily interactions.\n\nThis experience taught me an important lesson: we’re responsible for our own well-being, both physical and mental. It’s important to recognize when we need to pause and recharge. This isn’t weakness; it’s a sign of strength and self-awareness. Everyone’s path differs, and what works for one may not suit another. The key is finding what brings joy and fulfillment, and having the courage to pursue it, even when it’s difficult.\n\nFor those in similar situations, feeling trapped by financial security or fearing change, consider this: don’t undervalue your happiness and mental health. Life is brief, and spending it unhappily for a paycheck isn’t worthwhile. It’s possible to balance comfortable living with personal fulfillment.\n\nThis personal journey reflects a broader issue in our work culture, one that Malissa Clark explores in her book, Never Not Working: Why the Always-On Culture Is Bad for Business — and How to Fix It. Clark’s research aligns with my experience, showing how an excessive focus on work and financial gain can lead to burnout and dissatisfaction. Her book offers valuable insights for those struggling to balance career ambitions with personal well-being, providing practical strategies to break free from the “always-on” mentality that often accompanies high-paying, high-pressure jobs.\n\nIn summary, embracing change and prioritizing well-being can lead to a more meaningful life. As I continue this journey, I’m reminded of the importance of listening to ourselves and making choices that align with our true values. Each Monday now represents a new opportunity to build a life I’m proud of and excited about.\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck or unhappy, remember:\n\nlife shouldn’t revolve solely around work. It should focus on finding peace, prosperity, and contributing positively to the world. Take control of your happiness and well-being. You shape your own life, and it’s never too late for positive change.\n\nlife shouldn’t revolve solely around work.
