Math helped me see patterns, spot gaps, and think beyond the tools I was using.\n\nOver the years, I watched data analytics evolve from brute-force SQL queries and OLAP cubes to slick dashboards in Tableau and Power BI. Now, AI is rewriting the rules again.\n\nSQL, Excel, OLAP: The Workhorse Era\n\nBack then, analytics, to me, was about grinding. SQL queries pulled data, Excel pivot tables gave quick summaries, and OLAP cubes let us slice and dice — if you had the patience to set them up. The reports were solid but rigid. Change one thing, and you were back at square one.\n\nVisualization: The Age of Dashboards\n\nThen came Tableau and Power BI. Data became interactive and easier to digest, and executives finally had something they could play with.\n\nBut under the hood, it was the same grind — cleaning, modeling, and explaining the numbers. Dashboards made things look better, but they didn’t do the thinking for you.\n\nAI Enters the Picture\n\nNow AI doesn’t just show data; it understands it. Instead of hunting for insights, you ask questions, and AI gives answers — fast.\n\nIt sees trends, flags anomalies, and even suggests actions. We’ve moved from watching dashboards to making smarter decisions without the manual legwork.\n\nThe Analyst’s New Edge\n\nAI won’t replace analysts. It cuts the grunt work.\n\nThe best analysts will use AI to move faster, think bigger, and make better calls. Knowing how to frame the right questions, validate AI’s output, and tell a compelling data story is more valuable than ever.\n\nAnalytics isn’t what it used to be. The grind is fading. The opportunity? Wide open.\n\nAre you keeping up?",
