And Does It Work?\n\nMy Experience, Lessons, and What’s Next\n\nKenji\n\n31\n\nI\nhaven’t published in a while — not because I was off meditating in the mountains, but because I was stuck building AI agents that work. And let me tell you, that’s easier said than done.\n\nOver the last few months, I’ve broken things, fixed them, broken them again, and slowly started to figure out what’s real and what’s just hype.\n\nSo, this article is part reflection, part practical guide. If you’re trying to make sense of AI agents — what they are, what works, and what doesn’t — this one’s for you.\n\nThe Year of AI Agents? Let’s Be Real.\n\nEveryone is calling 2025 the Year of AI Agents. You hear it in podcasts, on X, and at every tech event. But let’s be honest:\n\nAre AI agents running our workflows or just sending bizarre emails at 3 AM?\n\nThe truth is somewhere in between. The potential is huge, but we’re still figuring out how to make them reliable, useful, and actually valuable.\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\nWhat Is an AI Agent, Really?\n\nAI agents aren’t just chatbots. The key difference? Agency — the ability to act, make decisions, and get stuff done without a human hovering over their shoulder.\n\nA solid AI agent should have:\n\n✔️ Memory — So it doesn’t forget everything after each conversation.\n✔️ Tools — So it can retrieve real-time info, automate tasks, and integrate with external systems.\n✔️ Autonomy — So it can execute tasks instead of just suggesting them.\n\nBut don’t be fooled. While agents sound independent, most still require oversight — especially in business settings where accuracy matters.\n\nThe Three Types of AI Agents\n\nNot all agents are the same. Based on what I’ve built, tested, and broken, I’d group them into three categories:\n\n1. Personal Agents (AI that works for you)\n\nThink of AI that manages your emails, schedules, travel bookings, and personal reminders.\n➡️ These agents are promising but hard to integrate across different tools.\n➡️ Right now, they’re not great at decision-making — so expect some weird calendar invites.\n\n2. Persona-Based Agents (AI that acts like an expert)\n\nThese specialize in well-defined tasks, like:\n🔹 Coding Assistants — Cursor helps developers write better code.\n🔹 Legal Agents — Harvey assists with contract analysis.\n🔹 Financial Analysts — AI that reviews spreadsheets and forecasts data.\n\nThese work better than personal agents because they operate in a structured environment with clear rules.\n\n3. Business & Customer Service Agents (AI that scales)\n\nLarge companies already use AI to automate customer interactions — handling FAQs, troubleshooting, and processing simple requests.\n\nWhere to Start: Real-World Use Cases\n\nIf you’re considering AI agents, don’t start by “deploying AI.” Start with a problem.\n\nGood Use Cases for AI Agents Today\n\n✅ Customer Support — Answering common questions, processing refunds, and automating responses.\n✅ Sales & Marketing — Generating leads, researching competitors, and writing content.\n✅ Finance & Operations — Document analysis, expense tracking, and contract review.\n\nTools to Build AI Agents\n\nIf you’re serious about building, check out CrewAI. It’s one of the best frameworks for structured AI workflows, memory, and multi-agent collaboration.\n\nCrewAI\n\nSimply provide an email address, and our AI will compile a detailed overview of the associated business.

Not yet.\n\nBut they’re getting smarter, and those who build and refine them today will be shaping the conversation tomorrow.\n\nLet’s get to work.",
