It is crazy good. Claude 3.5 Sonnet and other models were already impressive, but every new release brings at least an incremental improvement — if not a step change in what’s possible.\n\nAnd with Claude 3.7? The coding ability is a step change.\n\nHere’s how I see it:\n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet is…\n\nIt’s the perfect teammate.\n\nI honestly can’t believe we have a model this good for day-to-day coding. It’s unbelievable.\n\nThe Bigger Shift: The Knowledge Economy Is Changing\n\nThis isn’t just about coding. This is about the future of work.\n\nFor decades, success depended on what you knew. The best opportunities went to those who could memorize, analyze, and specialize in fields where knowledge was scarce.\n\nNow?\n✅ AI recalls everything instantly.\n✅ It analyzes, summarizes, and writes better than most people.\n✅ It codes at a level that makes software development faster than ever.\n✅ It generates ideas that challenge traditional creativity.\n\nIf your edge was knowing things, that edge is disappearing.\n\nThe 5 Skills That Matter Now\n\nI’m working on sharpening these, because they’ll define success in the years ahead.\n\nHow to Stay Ahead\n\nThe smartest people aren’t rejecting AI.
