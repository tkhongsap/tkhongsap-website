We’ve seen SpaceX making strides, Robotaxis expanding, and even Google buying a nuclear plant for clean computing energy. It feels like we’re racing towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). But when might we get there?\n\nDario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, just published a massive +13,000-word piece on when he thinks we’ll see AGI — or, as he calls it, Powerful AI (he’s not big on the term AGI).\n\nBefore we dig into the timeline, let’s clarify what we mean by “Powerful AI.” Ask ten AI experts, and you’ll probably get ten different answers. We’ll use Dario’s framework for this chat and swap between Powerful AI and AGI throughout.\n\nSo, what’s Powerful AI all about?\n\nFrom an engineering angle, one might think of AGI as AI systems achieving a set of benchmarks — crushing it in math, English, reasoning, medical exams, and even the bar exam. With AI models getting better so fast and halving error rates every six months, it’s not hard to imagine AGI coming soon.\n\nBut his take is broader and more advanced. His Powerful AI goes way beyond just passing tests. He’s talking about systems that can:\n\nHe also points out that we could use the resources that train these models to run millions of them at once — possibly by 2026.\n\nHe also points out that we could use the resources that train these models to run millions of them at once — possibly by 2026.\n\nThese systems could take in information and act 10 to 100 times faster than humans, though they might still hit snags with physical world stuff or certain software. These millions of AI instances could work on different tasks independently or team up like humans, creating a super-efficient, specialized workforce. Dario calls it a “country of geniuses in a data center” — able to tackle some of the world’s most challenging problems, though still limited by practical issues like how long it takes to build hardware or run experiments. He believes\n\nThe Powerful AI could at least 10x the rate of these discoveries, giving us the next 50–100 years of biological progress in 5–10 years.\n\nThe Powerful AI could at least 10x the rate of these discoveries, giving us the next 50–100 years of biological progress in 5–10 years.\n\nThe Potential and Responsibility of Powerful AI\n\nHis vision of Powerful AI is pretty exciting, with benefits that could seriously change the world. Think about advances in:\n\nBut as exciting as this is, the risks are just as big. That’s why Anthropic just updated its Responsible Scaling Policy — a crucial move to keep AI development in line with human values and safety.\n\nWhile Powerful AI could transform the world, Anthropic’s policy reminds us that we must not lose sight of the transformative benefits and risks.\n\nReferences:\n\nDario Amodei - Machines of Loving Grace\n\nHow AI Could Transform the World for the Better\n\ndarioamodei.com\n\nAnnouncing our updated Responsible Scaling Policy\n\nToday we are publishing a significant update to our Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), the risk governance framework we…\n\nwww.anthropic.com",
