This quiet launch, positioned right before OpenAI’s expected announcements, shows Google’s clear response to OpenAI’s O1 and O3 models.\n\nAI Reasoning Gets More Competitive\n\nThe timing matters. As OpenAI advances its reasoning capabilities, Google presents its own solution. The results speak volumes — on LMC’s leaderboard, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking ranks above both O1 Preview and O1 Mini, indicating that Google’s measured approach stands strong against well-known competitors.\n\nSee How AI Thinks\n\nThis model stands out because it shows its work. Unlike other AI models, including OpenAI’s offerings, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking lets users see its complete reasoning process. Users access the full chain of thought, not abbreviated summaries.\n\nA simple example proves this point: Given a misspelled “strawberrry,” the model first tries an answer, then corrects itself when asked to review. Or you can ask it to review your code, and you will see that the visible self-correction process differs from current O1 and O3 implementations.\n\nHere is an example of its thinking process when I asked it to review and optimize my code.\n\nThe user wants a code review and refactoring of their React component.\n\nHere’s a plan:\n\n1. Identify potential areas for improvement:\n\n2. Review the existing code section by section:\n\n3. Refactor the code based on the findings:\n\n4. Provide a detailed explanation of the changes:\n\nMore Features, Open Access\n\nThe model matches OpenAI’s recent visual and text processing abilities but adds a key difference: open access. With generous daily API limits, Google offers this technology free through AI Studio.\n\nThis release shows Google’s clear plan: combine advanced abilities with wide access. By making sophisticated AI reasoning available without cost barriers, Google changes how advanced AI reaches users and developers.\n\nThe choice to release this model quietly, despite its capabilities, points to a different approach in AI development. Google focuses on results over announcements, letting performance speak for itself.\n\nWhat Comes Next\n\nAs Google and OpenAI develop better AI reasoning systems, transparency and access become as vital as performance. This competition benefits everyone — especially users and developers who can now test these advanced AI capabilities.",
