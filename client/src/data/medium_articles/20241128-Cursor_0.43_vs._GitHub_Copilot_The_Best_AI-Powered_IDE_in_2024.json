If you’ve been watching AI-powered coding tools, you know the competition is heating up. GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and Codeium are all fighting for the top spot. But Cursor? It’s made some big moves with this update.\n\nThere’s a lot to love, but there are also a few things that need some work. Let’s break it all down: what’s new, how it compares to its competitors, and what it all means for the future of programming.\n\nWhat’s New in Cursor 0.43?\n\nHere’s what stands out in the latest update:\n\n1. The Composer Agent: A Huge Improvement\nThe Composer Agent is the big feature in this release. Cursor’s agent works with you. You can set rules, and the agent applies them to your code with impressive accuracy.\n\nWhat’s Great About It?\nThe agent delivers updates that seems to be almost error-free. When issues do pop up, the retry-on-lint-error feature fixes them quickly. It’s a huge improvement from earlier versions, where the AI sometimes left your code somewhat incomplete.\n\nWhat’s Great About It?\nThe agent delivers updates that seems to be almost error-free.

A Cleaner Composer Interface\nThe updated Composer tab is a big win. Instead of the old overlay design, it’s now fully integrated, making it easier to manage workflows. You can see inline diffs, track changes, and even get a sense of the agent’s decision-making process.\n\nCommunity Feedback:\nMost users love the new layout, but there are some bugs — like issues with creating or editing Notepads. These aren’t deal-breakers, but they do need fixing in future updates.\n\nCommunity Feedback:\nMost users love the new layout, but there are some bugs — like issues with creating or editing Notepads.

However, some previous tools — like long-context support and 200K-token models — have been removed.\n\nWhether these are temporary bugs or permanent changes isn’t clear yet, but their absence has confused some long-time users.\n\nWhether these are temporary bugs or permanent changes isn’t clear yet, but their absence has confused some long-time users.\n\n4. BugFinder: A Peek Into What’s Next\nWhile still experimental, BugFinder analyzes code changes between branches to catch potential issues early.\n\nIt’s a bit resource-heavy right now, but it shows promise for developers looking to save time during code reviews.\n\nIt’s a bit resource-heavy right now, but it shows promise for developers looking to save time during code reviews.\n\nCursor vs. GitHub Copilot: How They Compare\n\nI still use GitHub Copilot (don’t ask me why); it has been a strong contender in the AI coding world, especially with its integrations and partnerships. But Cursor holds its own and, in some ways, even pulls ahead.\n\nControl:\nCopilot can feel like a black box — it generates code, but you don’t always know why or how. Cursor, on the other hand, gives you tools like the Composer Agent to guide the process. You stay in charge of your code.\n\nIntegration and UI:\nCursor’s updated UI makes it easy to see what the AI is doing and why. Copilot doesn’t offer that same level of integration between developers' work and code.\n\nThat said, Copilot’s seamless integration with other tools is a big advantage. For developers already using Microsoft products, it’s tough to beat.\n\nBut for those looking for more control and innovation, Cursor still stands out.\n\nWill AI Replace Programmers?\n\nLet’s get real: tools like Cursor and Copilot aren’t here to take your job. They’re here to make it better.\n\nAI is great at handling repetitive tasks — writing boilerplate code, fixing lint errors, or automating migrations. This frees up developers to focus on the creative parts of programming: solving problems, designing systems, and coming up with new ideas.\n\nBut programming is evolving. To stay ahead, developers need to learn how to guide AI tools, make smart decisions, and use these systems effectively. The core of programming — creativity, logic, and problem-solving — remains human territory.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCursor 0.43 isn’t perfect, but it’s a major step forward. The Composer Agent, improved interface, and workflow enhancements show that Cursor is thinking about what developers really need. Yes, there are bugs and missing features, but these feel more like growing pains than deal-breakers.\n\nAs for whether AI will replace programmers? Not likely. The future of coding is about working with AI, not being replaced by it.",
