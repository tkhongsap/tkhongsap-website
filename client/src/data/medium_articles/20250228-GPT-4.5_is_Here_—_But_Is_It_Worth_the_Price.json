  "content": "Member-only story\n\nGPT-4.5 is Here — But Is It Worth the Price?\n\nKenji\n\nAI Unscripted\n\n8\n\nO\npenAI has introduced GPT-4.5, their latest and most capable model yet in terms of world knowledge.\n\nIt brings improvements in accuracy, conversation flow, and multimodal understanding. But let’s get straight to the point — this release feels a bit premature, and the API pricing is significantly higher than expected.\n\nSo, is this an actual leap forward, or just an expensive refinement?\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nGPT-4.5 builds on past models with several notable upgrades:\n\n✔️ Improved factual accuracy — It recalls information with greater precision.\n✔️ Lower hallucination rate — Responses are more reliable and grounded.\n✔️ Smoother, more intuitive conversation flow — It picks up on emotional tone and context better.\n✔️ Enhanced multimodal understanding — Performs well in image recognition and analysis.\n\nFrom early testing, it’s clear that GPT-4.5 excels in general knowledge and writing, making responses feel more natural and well-structured.\n\nThe Issues: Pricing and Purpose\n\nFor all its improvements, GPT-4.5 has some drawbacks, mainly in pricing and positioning.\n\n💰 The cost is significantly higher than GPT-4o:\n\nAt 30 times the price of GPT-4o, this is not a model aimed at general users.\n\nIt’s not a major jump for advanced reasoning tasks. While it’s more factually accurate, it still doesn’t match OpenAI’s dedicated reasoning models for complex problem-solving in areas like math, logic, and advanced coding.\n\nWho is this for? OpenAI seems to be targeting large organizations and developers building specialized AI applications rather than smaller teams or individual users.\n\nWhat’s Next? GPT-4.5 as the Foundation for Future AI\n\nOpenAI has positioned GPT-4.5 as a stepping stone for upcoming advancements. Future models will likely build on its expanded knowledge base, leading to:\n\n✔️ Better reasoning models\n✔️ More advanced AI assistants\n✔️ Stronger tool-using capabilities\n\nFor now, access is rolling out in stages:\n✔️ Pro users in ChatGPT today\n✔️ API developers across all paid tiers\n✔️ Team & Plus users next week\n✔️ Enterprise & EDU users in the following weeks\n\nIs GPT-4.5 Worth It? Final Verdict\n\nGPT-4.5 is a refinement rather than a breakthrough. It enhances world knowledge and accuracy but comes at a very high price. While it may serve as the foundation for future AI models, it’s not a must-have for most users today.",
