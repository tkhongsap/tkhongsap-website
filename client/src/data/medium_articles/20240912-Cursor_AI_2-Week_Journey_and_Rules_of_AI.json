  "content": "Cursor AI: 2-Week Journey and Rules of AI\n\nI’ve officially switched from GitHub Copilot to Cursor AI.\n\nKenji\n\n63\n\nTwo weeks into my journey with Cursor AI, I’ve fully transitioned from GitHub Copilot. The switch has significantly increased my productivity, mostly through multi-file editing and context-aware suggestions. This has reinforced my decision to subscribe to Cursor AI.\n\nLet’s recap the key features that have made this transition so impactful:\n\nWhile these features are impressive, I initially overlooked one more: “Rules for AI.” This feature has quickly become essential, enhancing the AI’s ability to match my coding style and project requirements.\n\nWhat are “Rules for AI”?\n\n“Rules for AI” allows you to set custom instructions that guide Cursor AI’s behavior when generating code or providing suggestions. It’s like having a system prompt to ensure your code aligns with your standards and best practices.\n\nSetting up “Rules for AI” is straightforward:\n\nFor Python:\n\nBenefits of “Rules for AI”\n\nIt’s worth noting that it takes time to fine-tune your rules and understand how they impact the AI’s suggestions. Additionally, overly restrictive rules might limit the AI’s creativity in problem-solving.\n\nAs I reflect on my journey from Copilot to Cursor, I’m struck by how rapidly the landscape of AI-assisted development is evolving. Other tools like Devin and Replit AI are pushing boundaries, which is good for us consumers. It is an exciting time, and I’m sure there will be more AI tools coming out. However, for now, I am sticking with Cursor AI.\n\nIf you find this helpful article, you might enjoy:\n\nOpenHands (formerly OpenDevin)\n\nInstallation OpenDevin Guide\n\nmedium.com\n\n2024 Podcast Playlist: 8 Essential Picks for Curious Minds\n\nDiscover the Podcasts That Will Keep You Informed, Inspired, and Entertained\n\nmedium.com",
