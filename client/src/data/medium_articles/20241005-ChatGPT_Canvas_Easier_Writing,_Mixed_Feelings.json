  "content": "ChatGPT Canvas: Easier Writing, Mixed Feelings\n\nNot Sure — A Non-Writer’s Perspective on AI’s Latest Writing Tool\n\nKenji\n\n26\n\nI’ve been under the weather for over a week, battling a nasty flu that’s been going around. While I was out of commission, the world kept spinning, and I missed quite a bit of news, from politics to tech announcements.\n\nOne thing that caught my eye as I scrolled through my backlog was OpenAI’s release of a new ChatGPT feature called Canvas. It’s a tool designed to help with writing and coding, offering features like suggesting edits, adjusting text length, and polishing content. My first thought? I’m not sure how to feel about this.\n\nLet me be clear: I’m not a writer by profession. In fact, I just started writing on Medium a few months ago, for personal development, learning about topics I’m interested in, and sharing my thoughts. It’s a bonus if what I share is useful to someone out there. But this new tool… it seems cool, but I can’t help wondering if it might take the fun out of writing if used too much.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, tools like ChatGPT can be great. They can definitely boost your productivity when you use them in your work. But they don’t guarantee better quality, do they? And for someone like me who writes to learn, I am sure that relying too heavily on AI might short-circuit that process.\n\nI haven’t tried ChatGPT Canvas yet, but I’m planning to give it a try. I’m keeping an open mind. Will it make writing feel more like a streamlined production line? Is that a good thing? I’m really not sure.\n\nFinding balance in the AI-assisted writing era\n\nFinding balance in the AI-assisted writing era\n\nAt the end of the day, I know tools like this will help people produce more content and improve productivity, and there’s nothing inherently wrong with that. But I can’t help but think about why we start writing in the first place. For me, it’s about learning and understanding. If I rush through it with AI help, will I still get that same depth of understanding?\n\nI guess what I’m trying to say is that while these new tools are part of how technology evolves, and we’ll adapt to them, it’s worth thinking about how we use them. Maybe the key is to find a balance — use the tool to help out, but not so much that we lose the personal touch and the learning that comes from wrestling with our own words.\n\nAs we explore these new AI writing tools, let’s remember why we write in the first place. Our unique experiences and perspectives are what make our writing valuable. While tools like Canvas are here to stay and will inevitably shape how we write, we have the power to decide how much we let them influence our process. For me, I’ll embrace the technology, but always prioritize the personal growth and learning that comes from expressing myself in my own voice. The key is to use these tools as aids, not replacements, for our own creativity and thought processes.",
