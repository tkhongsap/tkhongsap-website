They’re incredible at lowering the barrier for programming, often described as democratizing coding. They help individuals and teams boost productivity by simplifying repetitive tasks and accelerating project setups. But one fact we don’t discuss enough — or maybe gets drowned out in the hype — is this: there’s no shortcut to learning and no shortcut to mastery.\n\nTo truly understand something, you must spend time learning, working through, and thinking deeply about the process. Using AI to solve a complex math problem or write a proof doesn’t mean you’ve mastered math. The same principle applies to coding, software design, and other disciplines.\n\nDon’t get me wrong — I’m a big fan of tools like Cursor, Github Copilot, Replit, V0, etc. They’re powerful, and they save time. But I want to make the case that if you’re new to programming or looking to enter software engineering, it’s crucial to understand the foundations and the underlying concepts. That understanding will be invaluable as you progress.\n\nAccessibility Isn’t a Substitute for Expertise\n\nAI tools are exciting because they make coding more accessible. They simplify repetitive tasks, help kickstart projects, and enable faster development of MVPs or prototypes. These features can save hours and lower the barrier to entry for many aspiring developers.\n\nHowever, accessibility doesn’t equal expertise, and AI tools have their limitations. Here’s what these tools might not be able to do:\n\nEven when AI generates code that looks promising at first glance, it often needs multiple revisions to meet acceptable quality.\n\nUsing AI tools to write code doesn’t mean you’ve mastered coding. It accelerates processes, but developing the foundational understanding required to create functional, maintainable, and efficient systems takes time and effort. AI tools are helpful, but human oversight remains indispensable for ensuring long-term success.\n\n(for me) Understanding Beats Popularity\n\nBuilding expertise isn’t about how many followers or “hot takes” you have on social media. It’s about real, hands-on experience. In a world where flashy opinions dominate platforms, it’s easy to mistake popularity for credibility.\n\n🚨 If you don’t know how APIs work, can’t debug effectively, or lack an understanding of system design, you’re not building — you’re guessing.\n\nThrowing an entire codebase at an AI tool and expecting it to fix, scale, or optimize it is like handing a puzzle to a machine and hoping it guesses what the final image should look like.\n\nWithout a deeper understanding of your project’s goals and requirements, you risk creating inefficiencies, bugs, or worse — systems that can’t be maintained.\n\nThe Smart Way to Use AI Tools\n\nAI Tools like Cursor are best treated as a junior developer or a teaching assistant. It’s a tool to help you speed up the process, but it still needs oversight and guidance. Here’s how to use these tools effectively:\n\nKnowledge > Convenience\n\nAI platforms like Cursor are incredible for lowering entry barriers and improving productivity. But they’re not a replacement for hard-earned expertise.\n\nTrue mastery comes from combining tools with a solid foundation in software design and problem-solving. The tools are there to assist, but the real innovation comes when you understand the “why” behind what you’re building.\n\nSo yes, enjoy the boost these tools provide, but don’t forget the fundamentals. Because nothing beats the value of experience, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt when things don’t go as planned.",
