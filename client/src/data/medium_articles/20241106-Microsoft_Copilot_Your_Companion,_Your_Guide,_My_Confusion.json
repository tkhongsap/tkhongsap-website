Designed to assist with various tasks, Microsoft’s suite of AI tools has been useful for many.\n\nFor someone who doesn’t typically use Microsoft products, I recently found myself in an unusual situation: I had to build something with Copilot. “How hard could it be?” I thought. Spoiler alert — it was more complicated than I expected.\n\nI assumed this would be just another quick task. After all, I’ve worked with GPT, OpenAI APIs, and other AI tools — how different could this be? However, Microsoft’s unique naming conventions and collection of tools quickly proved me wrong.\n\nCopilot, Custom Copilot, Copilot Studio, Copilot Agent — what??!\n\nTypical Microsoft, right?\n\nAfter going through some of their documentation, I decided it might be easier to build a custom Copilot to understand Copilot itself. Does that sound practical? Maybe, maybe not. For me, creating a personalized guide felt like the most logical solution to make sense of it all.\n\nBuilding a Copilot to Understand Copilot\n\nTo help others who might find themselves in a similar situation, here’s a quick summary of Microsoft’s Copilot features and how they compare to other tools:\n\nIn short, Copilot is your AI assistant embedded within apps to handle everyday tasks. Custom Copilot and Copilot Studio provide tailored solutions to address specific business needs. Meanwhile, Copilot Agent focuses on automation and task execution, with exciting possibilities as it continues to evolve.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nHere’s my takeaway: it’s okay to feel overwhelmed by the terminology. I certainly did. It is more important to understand what they do. — it’s about learning, adapting, and occasionally laughing at the process.\n\nIf I’ve misunderstood anything or missed a key point, let me know. After all, we’re all in this together, figuring out how to make the most of technology.",
