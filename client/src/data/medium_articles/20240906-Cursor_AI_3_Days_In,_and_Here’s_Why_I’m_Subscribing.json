I was just starting to explore what this AI-powered coding tool could do. After putting it to the test under a tight deadline, I can confidently say it didn’t just meet my expectations — it exceeded them. 💥 Here’s why I’m not just impressed but ready to subscribe.\n\nFull disclaimer here: Coding has always been more of a hobby for me, occasionally spiraling into something more serious. So when an unexpected project landed on my desk with a tight deadline, I wondered if I would pull it off or watch it fall apart in front of my eyes.\n\nCursor AI — AI-Powered Coding Editor\n\nCoding Assistant: From Prompt to Project — Coding Smarter, Not Harder\n\nmedium.com\n\n⏩ Fast Forward to Today\n\nThe end of the week. Instead of drowning in bugs or scratching my head over deployment issues, I’m done. ✅ Tasks completed, deadline met, and my professional reputation intact. The secret to this unexpected success? I discovered Cursor AI three days ago. I’ve used 255 of my 500 free credits, and every single one was worth it.\n\nThe Precursor to Cursor AI\n\nAt first glance, Cursor AI seemed to offer standard features of an AI coding tool: code completion, bug fixing, debugging assistance, code refactoring suggestions, natural language to code generation, and code explanation and documentation. What really caught my attention were some unique capabilities:\n\nLittle did I know how crucial these features would become in just a few days.\n\nReal-Life Example: From Codebase Chaos to Clarity\n\nMy task was to overhaul a sprawling web application with multiple interconnected components. What seemed straightforward on paper quickly became a labyrinth of dependencies. Feeling overwhelmed, I turned to Cursor AI with a query:\n\n@Codebase, identify all files related to the main user interface and their dependencies\n\n@Codebase, identify all files related to the main user interface and their dependencies\n\nThe response was impressive. It returned a structured list of relevant files explaining their roles and relationships. In a sense, it gave me a comprehensive map of the codebase ecosystem. 🗺️\n\nOne of the reasons for this success is its codebase indexing feature, which I recommend everyone use. For a codebase of approximately 1GB, it took me about 5 minutes to complete the indexing. ⏳\n\nCodebase indexing can provide more accurate, project-wide suggestions and contextual edits across multiple files.\n\nThe Power of Contextual Multi-File Edits\n\nWith a clearer understanding of the codebase, I needed to implement a new design system across the entire application. This wasn’t a single file edit; it required changes across numerous components and styles. Here is an example of a prompt:\n\n@StyleComponents @ThemeConfig @GlobalStyles Update the primary color scheme to #3A86FF and ensure consistency across all related components and styles.\n\n@StyleComponents @ThemeConfig @GlobalStyles Update the primary color scheme to #3A86FF and ensure consistency across all related components and styles.\n\nIt analyzed the codebase, identified all relevant files, and proposed coordinated changes. It understood the context of each file, suggested appropriate modifications, and asked me to confirm before making the changes. 🔄\n\nExamples of Codebase and Document Queries\n\nThroughout the project, I relied on its ability to navigate and understand the codebase and relevant files. Here are some examples of queries that proved invaluable:\n\n“”Show me all the files handling user authentication and authorization.” 🔐\n“What files are related to API integration and data fetching?” 🌐\n“Update the error handling logic across all server-side components.” ⚠️\n\n“”Show me all the files handling user authentication and authorization.” 🔐\n\n“What files are related to API integration and data fetching?” 🌐\n\n“Update the error handling logic across all server-side components.” ⚠️\n\nEach query provided precise, contextual information that streamlined my workflow significantly.\n\n📝 Documenting the change\n\nBefore I left office today, I realized we needed comprehensive documentation of our changes. Once again, Cursor AI stepped up to the plate. I asked:\n\n“Generate a detailed report of all major changes made to the codebase during this project, including file names, nature of changes, and potential impacts on other components.”\n\n“Generate a detailed report of all major changes made to the codebase during this project, including file names, nature of changes, and potential impacts on other components.”\n\nIt produced a well-structured document outlining the changes with code snippets and explanations.\n\n💳 So, Why Am I Subscribing?\n\nAfter these three days, one thing is clear: Cursor AI isn’t just a nice-to-have tool — it’s essential. ✅\n\nIt saved me from drowning in complexity and gave me back control of the project. I’m not subscribing because I have to — I’m subscribing because I want to. 💡 Cursor AI made me faster, smarter, and more confident as a coder, even though I’m not a professional developer.",
