You open a browser, fire up an AI coding tool, and start talking. By dinner, the app runs on a server, you’ve clicked through the main flow, and the code is tucked safely in Git. That rush from scribble to screen is vibe coding, and it’s far easier than it sounds.\n\n1. Choose Your Playground\n\nPick an editor that lets you hit Run within minutes.\n\nPersonal note: I lean toward Cursor — its inline chat and quick refactor commands feel natural, especially when I’m polishing the frontend — but any tool that keeps you iterating quickly will do the job.\n\n2. Write the Plan Before You Write the Code\n\nCreate PLAN.md, then chat with the model:\n\nKeep the file open. After each step, tick it off so every new prompt has the same map.\n\n3. Commit Early, Commit Often\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Green tests: prep checkout flow\"\n\nIf the following change derails something,git reset --hard <hash> it restores a clean slate instead of a tangle of patches. It feels slow—until it saves an afternoon.\n\n4. Guard Rails: High-Level Tests\n\nAsk the model to write end-to-end tests that click through pages or hit real APIs. They catch silent regressions when the AI edits an unrelated file. Tests pass? Great. Tests fail? Reset, rethink, retry.\n\n5. Debugging: Paste the Error First\n\nDrop the whole thing into chat — no commentary needed. More than half the time, the model spots the fix outright. For stubborn bugs:\n\nSwitch models when stuck; each has blind spots.\n\n6. Remember: The Model Does More Than Code\n\nUse separate chats to:\n\nEvery non-coding task you offload frees your attention for architectural thinking.\n\n7. Refactor Frequently\n\nOnce tests pass, ask the model:\n\n“Show repetitive code or oversized functions worth cleaning — one file at a time.”\n\n“Show repetitive code or oversized functions worth cleaning — one file at a time.”\n\nAccept a suggestion, run the tests, commit, and repeat the process. Smaller files, more explicit naming, and service-style boundaries help both humans and large language models (LLMs) stay oriented.\n\n8. Keep Experimenting\n\nThe best model for planning today may lag on implementation tomorrow. Whenever a new version drops, try:\n\nTreat coding like any other skill: engage in deliberate practice, take careful notes, and hold regular retrospectives.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nVibe coding isn’t “cheating,” and it’s not autopilot. It’s a faster conversation with the machine — one that rewards old-school habits: plan first, test high, commit small, reset often. Follow that rhythm and you’ll discover you can turn a sketch into a functioning prototype in a single afternoon, not a full week.",
