Fair point, but hear me out. O3 isn’t available to the public yet — if you want access, you’ll need to apply to be a safety tester. Meanwhile, O1 is here, fully accessible, and still incredibly powerful for solving complex problems.\n\nHere’s another reason: I recently completed the Reasoning with o1 short course from deep-learning.ai, and it helped me understand this type of reasoning model.\n\nIf you’ve ever struggled to get the most out of these o1 family, this course is definitely worth a look. It covers everything from how o1 works to when (and when not) to use it.\n\nBelow, I’m sharing what I learned so you can skip the trial-and-error phase and start leveraging o1.\n\nWhy o1 is Worth Your Attention\n\no1 marked OpenAI’s first step into the reasoning-focused AI space. Unlike models that just spit out answers, o1 actually “thinks.” It breaks problems into smaller steps (a method called chain-of-thought reasoning) and even double-checks its answers using a technique called consensus voting. It’s perfect for tackling complicated tasks where accuracy matters, but here’s the catch: o1 isn’t for everything.\n\nLet’s dive into when to call on O1 and when to stick with simpler models.\n\nWhen to Use o1\n\nWhen to Skip O1\n\nAs much as I love o1, it’s not always the best choice.\n\nA Real-World Example\n\nHere’s a coding example straight from the course: using o1 and gpt-4o-mini to a React component for an interview feedback form. The requirements were clear:\n\nUsing both the o1-mini and GPT-4o-mini models, I prompted them to generate this component. The goal was to see how each model approached the same task.\n\nThe standout feature of O1-mini’s solution was its ability to build a more robust framework, making it easier to implement and ensuring the feedback form met all requirements.\n\nWant to compare the results for yourself? Here’s the code snippet used for this task:\n\n# Import necessary modules\nimport warnings\nfrom helper import get_openai_api_key\nfrom IPython.display import display, Image\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n# Suppress warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Retrieve OpenAI API key\nopenai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()\n\n# Initialize OpenAI client\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)\n\n# Constants for models\nGPT_MODEL = 'gpt-4o-mini'\nO1_MODEL = 'o1-mini'\n\ndef get_chat_completion(model, prompt):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calls the OpenAI API to get a chat completion.\n\n    :param model: The model to use for the completion.\n    :param prompt: The prompt to send to the model.\n    :return: The completion response from the model.\n    \"\"\"\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}],\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].message.content\n\n# Prompt for generating the React component\nreact_demo_prompt = \"\"\"Create an elegant, delightful React component for an Interview Feedback Form where:\n\n1. The interviewer rates candidates across multiple dimensions using rubrics\n2. Each rating must include specific evidence/examples\n3. The final recommendation should auto-calculate based on a weighted scoring system\n4. The UI should guide interviewers to give specific, behavioral feedback\n\nThe goal is to enforce structured, objective feedback gathering. A smart model should:\n- Create a thoughtful rubric structure\n- Add helpful prompts/placeholders\n- Build in intelligent validation\n\nMake sure to\n - Call the element FeedbackForm\n - Start the code with \"use client\"\n\nRespond with the code only! Nothing else!\"\"\"\n\n# Generate and display code from GPT-4o-mini model\nprint(\"Code from GPT-4o-mini:\")\ngpt_code = get_chat_completion(GPT_MODEL, react_demo_prompt)\nprint(gpt_code)\ndisplay(Image('gpt4_app_image.png'))\n\n# Generate and display code from O1-mini model\nprint(\"\\nCode from O1-mini:\")\no1_code = get_chat_completion(O1_MODEL, react_demo_prompt)\nprint(o1_code)\ndisplay(Image('o1_app_image.png'))\n\nThree Lessons for Mastering o1\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nO1 remains a powerful tool for tackling complex tasks. Whether you’re generating smarter code, solving abstract problems, or analyzing data, o1 can elevate your workflow when used thoughtfully.\n\nIf you’re serious about mastering its capabilities, the Reasoning with o1 course is a fantastic resource.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://learn.deeplearning.ai/",
