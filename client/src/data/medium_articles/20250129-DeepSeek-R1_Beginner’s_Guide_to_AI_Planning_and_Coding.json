From the announcement of Stargate to the official launch of DeepSeek-R1, the AI landscape is shifting fast.\n\nThe Stargate Project is a massive $500 billion initiative to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years, with an initial $100 billion already deployed. Backed by SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX, the project is designed to reinforce American leadership in AI while fostering economic growth and job creation.\n\nWhile Stargate focuses on infrastructure, DeepSeek has been making waves with its models. DeepSeek-R1 launched on January 20, 2025, and what really stands out is the cost efficiency.\n\nDeepSeek-R1 Release | DeepSeek API Docs\n\n⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1\n\napi-docs.deepseek.com\n\nTraining DeepSeek’s models are significantly cheaper compared to OpenAI’s models, which is something they’ve even broken down in their recent paper on arXiv. They’ve figured out how to optimize training while still delivering solid performance, so people are naturally paying attention.\n\nIn this article, I’ll share my thoughts on DeepSeek, my experience using it for planning and coding, provide real-world examples, and determine if it lives up to the buzz.\n\nMy Hands-On Experience: Hype or Reality?\n\nI have to admit I mostly use DeepSeek-R1 for planning and coding. While DeepSeek-V3 is decent, I still stick with ChatGPT or Claude for general conversations.\n\nPlanning with DeepSeek: A Hidden Strength\n\nHere’s a made-up example to illustrate how DeepSeek can assist in project planning: Prompt Example: Project Planning Request\n\nI'm developing a mobile health monitoring app that helps users track daily wellness metrics and create healthy habits.\n\nCurrent Situation:\n- Problem: Users want to monitor health trends but existing apps are complex\n- Context: Personal health tracking with social support options\n- Target Users: Health-conscious individuals ages 25-45\n\nKey Requirements:\n1. Daily health metrics tracking\n   - Sleep patterns\n   - Activity levels\n   - Mood tracking\n   - Water intake\n   - Basic vital signs\n\n2. User Experience\n   - Simple data input\n   - Visual progress charts\n   - Daily/weekly summaries\n   - Custom reminders\n\n3. Social Features\n   - Goal sharing\n   - Progress milestones\n   - Community challenges\n   - Anonymous data sharing\n\nTechnical Considerations:\n- Platform: iOS and Android\n- Core Features:\n   - Offline data storage\n   - Push notifications\n   - Health device integration\n   - Data export options\n\nQuestions:\n1. What core features should be included in MVP?\n2. How can we ensure user privacy while enabling social features?\n3. What are the key metrics for measuring app success?\n4. How should we approach health data visualization?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. MVP feature list\n2. Privacy considerations\n3. Technical architecture suggestions\n4. Development phases\n5. Potential risks and mitigation strategies\n\nI used DeepSeek-R1 to create a structured project plan with specific phases.\n\nCoding with DeepSeek: A Direct Comparison\n\nYou can add DeepSeek models in your Cursor Settings:\n\nDeepSeek’s API documentation includes sample code for managing chat history across multiple API requests.\n\nMulti-round Conversation | DeepSeek API Docs\n\nThis guide will introduce how to use the DeepSeek /chat/completions API for multi-turn conversations.\n\napi-docs.deepseek.com\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI(api_key=\"<DeepSeek API Key>\", base_url=\"https://api.deepseek.com\")\n\n# Round 1\nmessages = [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the highest mountain in the world?\"}]\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-chat\",\n    messages=messages\n)\n\nmessages.append(response.choices[0].message)\nprint(f\"Messages Round 1: {messages}\")\n\n# Round 2\nmessages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the second?\"})\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"deepseek-chat\",\n    messages=messages\n)\n\nmessages.append(response.choices[0].message)\nprint(f\"Messages Round 2: {messages}\")\n\nWhy Is Everyone Talking About DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek draws attention for key reasons:\n\nIs DeepSeek Changing the AI Field?\n\nLet’s look at the facts and set aside the excitement:\n\n✅ YES, it matters because:\n\n❌ NO, some questions remain:\n\nDeepSeek brings important changes to AI, but time will tell if it becomes a market leader or a strong option among many.\n\nShould You Pay Attention to DeepSeek?\n\nAs a regular user of OpenAI and Anthropic models, I see DeepSeek as a strong option. Though I use both, I plan to use DeepSeek-R1 more often, particularly for logic-based tasks.",
