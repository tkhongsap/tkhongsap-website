While most vision apps need complex prompt engineering and fine-tuning, I wanted to test a simpler approach first. This quick build bridges the gap between seeing and storytelling â€“ your silent media suddenly has context and voice. Just a proof of concept, but already turning everything from vacation clips to design mockups into narratives! Next steps: refine prompts and model fine-tuning.",
